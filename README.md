# 2-D Mario Game

## Credits

This is based off of this great tutorial: [Creating 2-D Games](http://processingjs.nihongoresources.com/test/PjsGameEngine/docs/tutorial/more-mario.html).

The complete tutorial and related files can be found [here](http://processingjs.nihongoresources.com/test/PjsGameEngine/docs/tutorial/) and [here](http://processingjs.nihongoresources.com/test/PjsGameEngine/docs/tutorial/graphics/).

This program needs the ddf/minim library, which can be found [here](https://github.com/ddf/Minim).


## Getting Started

1. Download [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) and set it up.
	1. Click on **processing.exe** in the processing folder you downloaded.
2. Go to the **Processing** directory created from clicking on **processing.exe** on your computer (usually in **Documents**).
3. Extract the downloaded **Minim-master** zip folder
4. Rename the extracted **Minim-master** folder to **Minim**. 
5. Put **Minim** in the **libraries** folder in the **Processing** directory.
	1. If there isn't a **libraries** folder, create one.
6. Download my code and put the **CatMario** folder (with the .pde code files) in the **Processing** directory.
7. Put all of the images (I have to send you these) in the **CatMario** folder.

## Playing the game
1. Open any .pde file in **CatMario** folder.
2. Click **Run** to start playing. The game uses **W, A, S, D** controls.
	1. If the controls are not working, click on the game window.
	2. After jumping, you can jump again if you are against a flat boundary (stage wall, side of a block, ect...)
	3. If you hold **w**, you jump higher and fall more slowly
